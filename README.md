# Play_song_on_YT_Using_Python

This code uses the pywhatkit library to play a song on YouTube. It prompts the user to enter the name of the song they want to play. If the song name is provided, it uses pywhatkit.playonyt(song) to search and play the song on YouTube. If there is any error during the process, it catches the exception and prints "Error While fetching". Otherwise, it prints "Song Played".
